        "FinRL is the first open-source framework to demonstrate the great potential of applying deep reinforcement learning in quantitative finance. We help practitioners establish the development pipeline of trading strategies using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). A DRL agent learns by continuously interacting with an environment in a trial-and-error manner, making sequential decisions under uncertainty, and achieving a balance between exploration and exploitation."

        "- Add technical indicators. In practical trading, various information needs to be taken into account, for example the historical stock prices, current holding shares, technical indicators, etc. In this article, we demonstrate two trend-following technical indicators: MACD and RSI.\n",
        "- Add turbulence index. Risk-aversion reflects whether an investor will choose to preserve the capital. It also influences one's trading strategy when facing different market volatility level. To control the risk in a worst-case scenario, such as financial crisis of 2007–2008, FinRL employs the financial turbulence index that measures extreme asset price fluctuation."
