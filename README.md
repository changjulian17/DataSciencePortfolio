# Welcome to Julian's Portfolio!

Hi! Thank you for taking the time to visit **Julian Chang's Data Science Portfolio**. Most of the work here was performed during my time as a part-time student at General Assembly. As part of the Data Science Immersive I've completed many projects.

My capstone is the [Investment_Portfolio](https://github.com/changjulian17/DataSciencePortfolio/tree/main/Investment_Portfolio) where I challenged myself to apply a Reinforcement learning algorithm and I implemented a Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to trade on a daily basis in a multi-asset class environment.

Another project I completed as part of an interview assessment was for Singapore's [Resale HDB market](https://github.com/changjulian17/resale_HDB). Here I used python to access APIs to get geolocation and also determine nearby MRT and shopping mall locations. I also set up 3 views in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julian.chang/viz/FirstDashboard_16315416189430)
